    <h2>Use Case case study</h2>
<div>
    This proposed software system is to be designed to allow passengers to check in and get the boarding pass for flying. The baggage can also be checked-in, which is optional. The check-in can happen by the counter clerk or by the passenger using a kiosk. The baggage must be checked for its weight and if more than the specified value, must be charged extra.
The system should allow individuals as well as a group of passengers to check-in through the system. The boarding pass can be issued through this system. Passengers below 4 yrs need not have tickets. The airport also allows provision for the special needs of passengers like wheelchairs etc.
The system should also be able to capture the fact that the baggage for a passenger is screened by security.
